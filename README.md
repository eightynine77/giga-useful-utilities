# giga useful utilities
a collection of windows batch scripts you can use to make your computing much easier

#note
if you spot any batch files with similar names like [piepod.bat](https://github.com/eightynine77/giga-useful-utilities/blob/main/giga%20useful%20utilities/piepod.bat) and [piepod_youtube_downloader.bat](https://github.com/eightynine77/giga-useful-utilities/blob/main/giga%20useful%20utilities/piepod_youtube_downloader.bat) then i want you to know that those files are actually symlink files. so in this case, [piepod.bat](https://github.com/eightynine77/giga-useful-utilities/blob/main/giga%20useful%20utilities/piepod.bat) is the symlink
